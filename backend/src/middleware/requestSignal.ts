 * A signal that fires when the client goes away before the response is sent.
 *
 * Threaded down to the AI transport so a user who closes the tab mid-batch
 * kills the model calls (and, on the CLI provider, the child processes) rather
 * than leaving them to run out the clock against the subscription seat. Lived
 * in routes/resume.ts until the profile editor's Write with AI needed it too
 * (routes/profiles.ts); one copy, so the two routers cannot drift.
 *
 * Keyed on `res` rather than `req`: `req` emits 'close' on normal completion
 * too, so listening there would abort work that had already succeeded.
